My personal budget app written in python

I wanted to keep track of my personal finance when I graduated from high school in 2015. I've seen some avalaible Excel sheets for that purpose but I wasn't satisfied with them. I've made my own App therefore. It was in Excel back then since that was the only coding language I could speak. Time passed by and I've discovered Python so I started rewriting my App. First working version was purely procedural and left like that for years.
I want to rewrite it one more time since I have way more experience with programming.
I focus on following things with this version:
 <ul>
  <li>Clean code</li>
  <li>Test driven development</li>
  <li>Automate my workflow with state-of-the-art tools: GitHub Actions, flake8, black</li>
</ul>
